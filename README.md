# cflieOffboardAAU

Implements a simple external/offboard position control loop for the Crazyflie, based on positioning data from a socket connection (tested with the GamesOnTrack experimental positioninhg system). 

Code meant to compile on the Windows platform.

Dependenies: libcflieAAU ( https://github.com/lkdo/libcflieAAU )
       
Meant to be useful when starting working with the Crazyflie, at Aalborg University Automation & Control Lab.
